    <h2>This service has been stopped.</h2>
    <p>
        First of all we would like to inform you that our service is NOT authorized by Bahir Dar University and the
        university doesn't know about this application.
    </p>
    <p>
        We developed this application out of curiosity without thinking about the legal framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>And</b> grade conversion is possible ONLY after graduation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore :) We can't be liable for any conversion errors you found on this application. Especially for those of
        you who have an incorrect conversion result because of your add and drop course.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please wait until your graduation to get your converted grade.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks and Congratulations.
