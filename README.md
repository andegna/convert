# This service has been stopped.

First of all we would like to inform you that our service is NOT authorized by Bahir Dar University and the university doesn't know about this application.

We developed this application out of curiosity without thinking about the legal framework.

And grade conversion is possible ONLY after graduation.

Therefore :) We can't be liable for any conversion errors you found on this application. Especially for those of you who have an incorrect conversion result because of your add and drop course.

Please wait until your graduation to get your converted grade.

Thanks and Congratulations.
